                  &quot;We will look to honour our women; we will encourage
                  them, build them up and support them in realising their
                  inestimable potential. As we do this, we will also see the
                  multiplier effect in the collective development of our people.
                  We will ensure that our women, both old and young, are
                  honoured and respected not only by word but in actual cultural
                  practice. We will look to actively seek the opinion and
                  counsel of our women, and opportunities that avail themselves
                  to the Itsekiri nation will be used to empower our women to
                  enable them to contribute their substance to the growth and
                  development of the Itsekiri Nation. So I say to our women
                  today, you will no longer be invisible&quot;
